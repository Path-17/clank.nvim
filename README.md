# layup.nvim

Just a basic lua extension to run bash commands in place on highlighted text.

I mostly use nvim as a notepad replacement at work rather than coding, so it's something I wanted to make for myself.

# TODO

Make the extension's one function lmao

Assign the function to keybindings for replace in place, and replace in place + copy to clipboard(both nvim " reg and system clipboard).
